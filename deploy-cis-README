#
# as sysadmin:
# place a copy tarball file on the destination server
#
# as root (staying in ~root/ directory:
# mv tarball file .
# tar zxvf tarball file
#
# cd deploy-cis-lvl1-hardening
# ./deploy-cis-lvl1-script-v1.3.sh
#

# The CIS Benchmark score should hit 70% and over.
# Refer to the handbook for the manual items such as /etc/fstab and aide installation
